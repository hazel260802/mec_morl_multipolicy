## Multi-Objective Deep Reinforcement Learning for SDN Edge Computing (MEC-MORL)

This repository contains the Python code implementation for the paper titled "Multi-objective Deep Reinforcement Learning for SDN Edge Computing". The proposed approach aims to optimize task offloading decisions in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) Edge Computing environments using Multi-Objective Deep Reinforcement Learning (MORL).

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- OpenAI Gym

### Usage

To train the MEC-MORL model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hazel260802/mec_morl_multipolicy.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the training script:

```bash
python train.py
```
